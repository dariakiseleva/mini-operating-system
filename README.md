## The Work

- [x] Write function that creates folder
- [x] Write function that deletes folder
- [x] Integrate both functions into main program, compile new file together -> Order of compilation
- [x] Make partitioned shell memory into variables, 100 and 900 for now
- [x] Write the `resetmem` function

## Come back to...
- [ ] Last part of `add_file_to_mem` in A2 where they clean the memory. bugs in for loop?
